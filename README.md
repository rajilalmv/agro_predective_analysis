# agro_predective_analysis
IoT based predctive analysis of soil and environmental parameters for sustainable agriculture.
Here in this project i incorporated LightGBM based predictive analysis of soil and environmental parameters for sustainable agriculture. Targeted SMOTE oversampling strategy was implemented to 
address class imbalance in minority crop categories, leading to enhanced model generalization. for analysing the impact of features on prediction SHAP analysis is performed.
